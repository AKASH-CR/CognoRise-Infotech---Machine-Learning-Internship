# CognoRise Infotech - Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my 1-month Machine Learning internship at CognoRise Infotech. During this internship, I worked on three ML tasks that involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Each project addresses a unique problem using machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.

Projects
1. Breast Cancer Prediction
      Objective: To develop a model that can accurately classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from a breast mass.
      Dataset: The dataset used for this project was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
      Techniques: Data preprocessing, feature selection, and training of classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine.
      Results: Achieved an accuracy of XX% with the best-performing model.
2. Diabetes Prediction
      Objective: To predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on various health indicators like BMI, age, blood pressure, and glucose levels.
      Dataset: The dataset used is the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset, which is publicly available.
      Techniques: Data cleaning, handling missing values, scaling, and model training using algorithms such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost.
      Results: Best model accuracy of XX%, indicating a strong ability to identify potential diabetes cases.
3. House Price Prediction
      Objective: To predict house prices based on various features like location, number of rooms, square footage, and other property-specific details.
      Dataset: This project uses the well-known Boston Housing dataset.
      Techniques: Applied feature scaling, data transformation, and regression models such as Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting.
      Results: The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error of XX, providing insights into the factors that most impact house pricing.
